This is my third repository. My task here is to predict the onset of diabetes for 768 patients based on their diagnostic measures.

# Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The repository contains the dataset file in csv as "diabetes.csv", license, this read me file, and my notebook titled "Diabetes prediction.ipynb".
